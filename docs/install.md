### Install

We recommend creating a new environment with Python 3.7.
```bash
conda create -n ballistico python=3.7
```
Alternatively you can use Python 3.6. The Tensorflow module doesn't seem to be compatible with Python 3.8, yet.

Ballistico installation can be done using `pip`
```bash
pip install ballistico
```
