This example illustrates how to perform thermal transport simulation for a bulk silicon (2 atoms per cell) system using hiPhive to extract 
force constants from ASE_QE reference force calculations.


External files required: 
		        1) Si.pz-n-kjpaw_psl.0.1.UPF

The calculation proceeds as follows:

		        1_Si_hiPhive_generate_fcs.py:	
		        1-1). Generate 50 reference structures and perform force calculations with standard rattle scheme.

		        1-2). Set up StructureContainer with 2nd and 3rd order cutoffs of 4.0 angstrom.

			1-3). Develop force constant potential model by fitting the reference structures and force calcualtions  with least square methods.

			1-4). Extract 2nd and 3rd order force constants from force constant potential model and set up input files for kALDo with hiPhive format.

			2_Si_hiPhive_thermal_conductivity.py:
			2-1). Set up force constant object by loading in the 2nd, 3rd force constants computed from hiPhive.

		        2-2). Set up phonon object (7x7x7 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

			2-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with Relaxation
			           Time Approximation (RTA), self-consistent (sc) and direct inversion of scattering matrix (inverse) methods.


			

In order to use QE with ASE, set the environment variable:

			export ASE_ESPRESSO_COMMAND="mpirun -np 8 /path/to/pw.x -in PREFIX.pwi > PREFIX.pwo"				

To run this example, navigate to this directory and execute:
			
		        python 1_Si_hiPhive_generate_fcs.py

			or

			./get_precalculated_fc.sh
			
 			
			python 2_Si_hiPhive_thermal_conductivity.py
