Example 3_silicon_clathrate_tersoff_custom_lammps illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for a type I clathrate (46 atoms per cell) system using LAMMPS 
USER-PHONON package as a force calculator.

The forceconstant calculation proceeds as follows:
			in.Si46:
			1-1).  Compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
			or
			get_precalculated_fc.sh:
			2-1).  Download precalculated forceconstants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON


The phonon calculation proceeds as follows:

		        1_Si46_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py:
		        1-1). Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS.

		        1-2). Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

			1-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with Relaxation
			           Time Approximation (RTA), self-consistent (sc) and direct inversion of scattering matrix (inverse) methods.


To run this example, navigate to this directory and execute:
			./lmp_mpi < in.Si46 > Si46.log or ./get_precalculated_fc.sh
		        python 1_Si_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py
