Example 1_carbon_diamond_Tersoff_ASE_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal transport simulation for a carbon 
diamond (2 atoms per cell) system using ASE and LAMMPS as force calculator.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

		        1_C_Tersoff_fc_and_harmonic_properties.py:	
		        1-1). Set up force constant object and compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants using C.tersoff.

		        1-2). Set up phonon object (5x5x5 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K and compute
			      harmonic properties (dispersion relation, group velocity , density of states and heat capacity).


		        2_C_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py:
		        2-1). Set up force constant object and compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants using C.tersoff.

		        2-2). Set up phonon object (5x5x5 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

			2-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with Relaxation
			           Time Approximation (RTA), self-consistent (sc) and direct inversion of scattering matrix (inverse) methods.

			3_C_Tersoff_visualize_anharmonic_properties.py:
			3-1). Compute and visualize phase spaces.
			3-2). Compute and compare phonon life times with RTA and direct inversion methods.
