Example 5_diamond_tersoff illustrates how to perform thermal transport simulation for a carbon 
diamond (2 atoms per cell) system using ASE and LAMMPS as a force calculator.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

		        1_C_Tersoff_fc_and_harmonic_properties.py:	
		        1-1). Set up force constant object and compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants using C.tersoff.

		        1-2). Set up phonon object (5x5x5 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K and compute
			      harmonic properties (dispersion relation, group velocity and density of states).


		        2_C_Tersoff_anharmonic_properties_and_conductivity.py:
		        2-1). Set up force constant object and compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants using C.tersoff.

		        2-2). Set up phonon object (5x5x5 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K and compute
			      anharmonic properties (heat capacity and phase space).

			2-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with Relaxation
			           Time Approximation (RTA), self-consistent (sc) and direct inversion of scattering matrix (inverse) methods.

			2-4).   Compute and compare phonon life times with RTA and direct inversion methods.
